# Test Plan and Results

## Overall Test Plan
Our approach to testing focuses on two main approaches. First, we will test individual system components, such as API data retrieval, user authentication, prediction submission, and database integration, using controlled inputs. These tests will cover both normal and abnormal conditions, including invalid league identifiers and incorrect date ranges, to ensure the system handles errors gracefully.

Second, we will test the full system as an integrated application by simulating real user workflows across multiple supported sports and esports leagues. This phase will validate end-to-end functionality, including logging in, creating challenges, submitting predictions, and viewing results, while ensuring consistent behavior across different leagues. Together, these testing phases help ensure Bracketed is reliable, scalable, and functions correctly under realistic usage scenarios.
