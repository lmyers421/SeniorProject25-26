## Co-op or Other Experience and Responsibilities
### **Computer Science Intern, Modern Technology Solutions, Inc., Dayton, Ohio. (3 semesters)**
- Worked as a software developer on an aircraft simulation project, contributing to the design, implementation, improvement, and testing of new and existing features
- Applied Agile and Scrum principles to plan, prioritize, and complete work in iterative sprints
- Participated in daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives
- Collaborated with a small development team to enhance simulation functionality while ensuring code quality, scalability, maintainability, and readability
- Coordinated frequently with another software team that focused on emerging capabilities in our project, ensuring both teams could work in parallel
- Participated in code reviews, integrating peer feedback and providing insights to align with project standards and best practices
- Integrated new versions of libraries and environments to maintain compatibility, improve performance, and leverage updated features to add new functionality

### **Psychiatry Student Co-op, Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio. (2 semesters)**
- Prepared, tested, and executed MATLAB scripts to assist with the preprocessing and analysis of neurophysiological data collected in patients with Fragile X syndrome and typically developing controls
- Implemented and tested various algorithms to determine the method that best removes non-brain artifact from EEG signals while preserving neural activity
- Developed a visual discrimination paradigm that makes use of eye tracking, positive and negative feedback, and auditory distractors to allow for more interpretable results while minimizing timing inconsistencies present in performing studies with both Fragile X and typically developing control participants
- Modified an existing reversal learning behavioral paradigm to allow it to be used on multiple different operating systems, including iOS and Android, while maintaining consistent timing and fixing existing bugs
