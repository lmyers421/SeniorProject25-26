## Co-op Work Experience
### Quality Assurance Co-op
London Computer Systems – January 2023 – April 2023

•	 Experienced the workflow and habits of being a QA tester firsthand to improve future relationships with QA testers while in a development role, as their experience is familiar. 

•	Honed communication skills in daily and weekly meetings to give quick, concise project updates using clear language to help those not associated with the projects.

### Software Development Co-op
London Computer Systems – August 2023 - December 2023, May 2024 – August 2024

•	Introduced to Angular, HTML, and CSS languages and worked to improve skills via experience and asking questions, as well as specialized courses throughout the duration of this co-op experience. 

•	Worked with a team of other developers and QA specialists to fully understand the software development workflow, including regular meetings and frequent communication with other developers. 

•	Contributed to a project with a short deadline, gaining experience in working with a team to coordinate multiple features at once, turning around changes efficiently, and dealing with new specifications. 

•	Assisted in overhauling an existing page on the software, which included logic changes, new features being added, visual/styling changes, and the consideration of future components using this new code.

### Software Development Intern
Medpace – January 2025 – August 2025

•	Modernized a legacy web application into Angular, improving the function and look of the frontend, as well as updating the backend and database as necessary.

•	 Learned and experienced some Microsoft Azure tools while setting up new features for the Angular application, such as sign-in features, user verification, and shared user-session abilities.

•	Collaborated with team members across the United States, as well as other countries, leading to increased need to capitalize on time that we could interact directly, which allowed me to better manage time spent working with them.

## Project Sought
I am looking to work on a project that is fun and engaging, that also challenges me to improve my skills and/or learn new skills.  My experience is primarily with frontend and backend on web projects, but I am happy to branch out and learn something new to increase my overall experience.
