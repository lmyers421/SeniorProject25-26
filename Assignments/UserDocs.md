# Bracketed User Documentation
Short Description
---
Bracketed is a web-based platform that lets users create and participate in pick’em-style prediction challenges across multiple sports and esports. Instead of using separate apps or websites for each league, Bracketed brings everything together in one place.

Users can join existing challenges or create their own, make predictions for games or matches, and track results as events progress. Bracketed is designed to be easy to use for casual fans while still supporting a wide range of leagues and competitive formats.
