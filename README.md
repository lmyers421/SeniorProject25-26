## Project Abstract
Bracketed is a web-based platform that unifies pick’em competitions across both sports and Esports. The platform aims to simplify user participation by offering a central hub where fans can make weekly predictions, track leaderboards, and compare results with others. The project emphasizes intuitive design, seamless database integration, and responsive web functionality. Our backend will handle user authentication, match data retrieval, and scoring automation. Bracketed’s long-term goal is to provide a scalable, community-oriented environment for competitive sports and Esports prediction enthusiasts.​

## Project Description
Bracketed is a web-based platform where users can join or create "pick’em" contests across multiple sports and esports in one unified hub. Users predict winners, track scores, and compete with friends in leagues or leaderboards.

## User Stories and Design Diagrams
### User Stories
- As a sports fan, I want to make weekly pick'em predictions across multiple leagues so that I can compete with my friends and track my performance.
- As an Esports follower, I want to view leaderboards for different competitions so that I can see how my predictions compare to others in the community.
- As a casual user, I want to access both sports and Esports pick'ems on the same platform so that I don't have to use multiple apps or websites.
- As a competitive user, I want to see the results of my past picks so I can analyze my performance and improve over time.
- As a new user, I want a simple and intuitive interface so I can start making picks right away without the need of complex instructions.

## ABET Concerns Essay
Our project will interact with economic, legal, security, and ethical concerns. 

Economic:  
While some API’s may charge a fee for a subscription to connect to their databases, some are free such as API-Football which is a good contender for what we will use. It may cost some money from us in the form of power usage when hosting the server/database or performing tests on a locally hosted webpage, but this cost is negligible in the longterm. Our final product will not be connected to UC or any other external help besides the API that we have decided to use for this project, so our costs should stay low.  

Security concerns:  
Because our project will have a login system, there exists the possibility that user information such as passwords could be retrieved from the database should someone try to access the system.  We will also include some basic personal information such as users’ names so that other users will be able to identify each other more easily if they are added as friends.  We would recommend that users keep their passwords unique so that there is no risk of any larger impact should they get leaked.  Security is always a concern, no matter the size or scope of the project, since user information should always be kept private. 

Legal:  
A major legal constraint for Bracketed involves the use of intellectual property from professional sports and esports leagues such as the NFL, NBA, League of Legends, and Overwatch. These organizations control the use of their logos, team names, and other branded materials. Therefore, our project will have to use only publicly available data such as scores, schedules, and statistics obtained from approved or open-source APIs. If Bracketed was to ever be expanded beyond a senior project, we would need to pursue official licensing or data agreements to ensure full legal compliance.  

Ethical:  
In its current state, there will be little to no ethical constraints for the project. However, if the project expands, there will be some ethical concerns that will need to be addressed. The website will have the ability for users to add friends and invite them to challenges, which will start to create a community. It will be an ethical obligation to monitor this community to prevent harassment, hateful activity, and bullying. Many sports games often involve gambling, and if any monetary transactions or rewards were ever included into the site, it would be important that effects of sports betting and gambling addiction would not be abused or capitalized on just for the benefit of the website.
